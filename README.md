Agoda Test - Compression
===

Although it may cost me to forgo a few things:
- writing in Scala
- potentially interchangeable compression algorithm

I would hope my submission could be considered for the following reasoning:
- I have totally no clue on how to use other compression algorithm
- I would try to write in Scala for the remaining time, but it may or may not be complete
